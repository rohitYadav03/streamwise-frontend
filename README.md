# 🎬Stremawise React + TypeScript Movie Explorer (Practice Project)

This is a **practice project** I built to learn and get hands-on with **React, TypeScript, Zustand, and API integration**.  
It consumes data from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to display movies like **Now Playing** and **Popular**, with hover effects and genre labels.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React + TypeScript** → component-driven UI with type safety  
- **Zustand** → lightweight state management  
- **Axios** → API calls  
- **Tailwind CSS** → styling  
- **TMDB API** → movie data

## 📌 Features Implemented
- 🎥 Fetch and display **Now Playing** and **Popular** movies  
- 🖼️ Movie cards with poster, rating, year, and HD badge  
- 🎭 Show movie genres (mapped from TMDB IDs → names)  
- ✨ Hover effect → expandable card with actions (Play, Add, Like, More Info)  
- 🔄 Zustand store for API state management (`allMovie`, `popularMovie`, `backgroundMovie`)
